Paion Open Source Website
=========================

Open source is made by people just like you. Please invest a few hours contributing to the software you are interested
in.

## What this is

This repository is the source code for <https://paion-data.github.io/opensource.paion-data/>.

Paion Open Source is a movement to encourage both internal and external people, and maintainers to contribute to open
source software in a world of welcoming openness.

Open Source Software (OSS) is the backbone of most software, tools, apps, electronics and more that we use every day.
Not only is Open Source Friday about encouraging people to contribute, but it's about encouraging businesses to give
back to the software they use by setting aside time for our colleagues to work on OSS on the clock.

On the website you'll find a number of guides on getting started with open source in general and more specific
information about contributing to Paion Data .
