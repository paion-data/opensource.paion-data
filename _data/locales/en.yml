      message: 'Once you are a maintainer on a project that others rely on, open source goes from "sharing the code" to "sharing the maintenance". As we all know, "maintenance" takes time which is most effectively spent in a continuous block to help make sure you can finish that e.g. code review before you start to lose context.'
